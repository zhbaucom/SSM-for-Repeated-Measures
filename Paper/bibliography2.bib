  abstract = {This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report discusses the challenges of providing equitable health care for people with dementia in the United States. An estimated 6.2 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth‐leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth‐leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated in 2020 by the COVID‐19 pandemic. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 15.3 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2020. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $256.7 billion in 2020. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers’ increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes — costs that have been aggravated by COVID‐19. Average per‐person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2021 for health care, long‐term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $355 billion. Despite years of efforts to make health care more equitable in the United States, racial and ethnic disparities remain — both in terms of health disparities, which involve differences in the burden of illness, and health care disparities, which involve differences in the ability to use health care services. Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans continue to have a higher burden of illness and lower access to health care compared with Whites. Such disparities, which have become more apparent during COVID‐19, extend to dementia care. Surveys commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association recently shed new light on the role of discrimination in dementia care, the varying levels of trust between racial and ethnic groups in medical research, and the differences between groups in their levels of concern about and awareness of Alzheimer's disease. These findings emphasize the need to increase racial and ethnic diversity in both the dementia care workforce and in Alzheimer's clinical trials.},

The NIA appointed the ADC Clinical Task Force to determine and define an expanded, standardized clinical data set, called the Uniform Data Set (UDS). The goal of the UDS is to provide ADC researchers a standard set of assessment procedures, collected longitudinally, to better characterize ADC participants with mild Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment in comparison with nondemented controls. NACC implemented the UDS (September 2005) by developing data collection forms for initial and follow-up visits based on Clinical Task Force definitions, a relational database, and a data submission system accessible by all ADCs. The NIA requires ADCs to submit UDS data to NACC for all their Clinical Core participants. Thus, the NACC web site (https://www.alz.washington.edu) was enhanced to provide efficient and secure access data submission and retrieval systems.},

  abstract = {ObjectivesWe report the cognitive decline in persons diagnosed with mild dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) during 5 years of annual follow-ups.MethodsPatients were recruited into the study from geriatric, psychiatric and neurology clinics in Western Norway during 2005–2013. They were diagnosed according to clinical consensus criteria, based on standardised clinical rating scales. Autopsy-based diagnoses were available for 20 cases. Cognitive decline for up to 5 years was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Survival analysis including Cox regression (time to reach severe dementia) and linear mixed-effects (lme) modelling were used to model the decline on MMSE.ResultsAt least one follow-up assessment was available for 67 patients with DLB and 107 patients with AD, with a median follow-up time of 4.3 years. The time to reach severe dementia was significantly shorter in DLB (median 1793 days) compared with AD (1947 days; p=0.033), and the difference remained significant in the multiple Cox regression analysis (HR=2.0, p<0.02). In the adjusted lme model, MMSE decline was faster in DLB (annual decline 4.4 points) compared with AD (3.2 points; p<0.008).ConclusionsOur findings show that from the mild dementia stage, patients with DLB have a more rapid cognitive decline than in AD. Such prognostic information is vital for patients and families and crucial for planning clinical trials and enabling health economic modelling.},

  abstract = {Objective
  Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia are frequent and challenging for patients, carers, and the health care system, but few long‐term studies exist. We analyse the longitudinal course of NPS in patients with mild dementia.
  Methods
  A longitudinal cohort study of 223 patients with mild dementia and annual assessments using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) for 5 years.
  Results
  A total 1043 NPI assessments, representing 97% of all possible measurements of living cohort members, were analysed. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were common at baseline, and only a moderate increase in total NPS score from 15 to 17 with no increase in the proportion with high NPI total scores. Ninety seven percent scored ≥16, and 49% scored ≥36 on NPI total score at least once during follow‐up. Individual NPS fluctuated and often reappeared. The most common symptoms ever reported was apathy (83%), depression (63%), appetite (63%), and aberrant motor behavior (60%). Cognitive decline was associated with higher NPI total score and several NPI items, but only the frequency of apathy increased significantly with time. Lewy body dementia was associated with higher NPI total score and psychotic symptoms. Alzheimer's disease was associated with increase in apathy.
  Conclusions
  Severe NPS are already common at time of dementia diagnosis, and the increase in overall severity over 5 years was moderate. Individual symptoms tend to fluctuate over time within patients and correspond to states rather than traits. These findings highlight the need to focus on, and plan for, NPS as part of dementia pathway, and are relevant for clinical trial design.},

  abstract = {The APOE genotype predicts the age at onset of Alzheimer disease (AD) and neuropathologic progression. However, studies relating APOE alleles to the rate of cognitive decline have been inconclusive. This may stem from their use of linear statistical analyses.
  To model relations of APOE alleles to the rate of cognitive decline in AD, nonlinearly.
  Serial measures of cognitive ability were obtained using the cognitive scale of the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly in 218 patients with AD. The relations of these serial scores to APOE alleles were tested using nonlinear and linear mixed-effects models.
  In the non-linear model, possession of an APOE epsilon4 allele related to earlier and faster cognitive decline, but possession of an APOE epsilon2 related to slower decline. Patients homozygous for APOE epsilon4 showed faster cognitive decline than heterozygotes. The linear model was less sensitive and did not detect differences between APOE epsilon4 homo- and heterozygotes.
  APOE genotype strongly predicts the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease. The decline shows a dose-response relation with the APOE epsilon4 allele, but the APOE epsilon2 allele is protective. The nonlinear model yielded larger estimates of the maximal rate of decline than the linear.},

  abstract = {The relation between vitamin B-12 and cognitive function in older adults is unclear. Limited evidence suggests that the relation is modulated by apolipoprotein E epsilon4. Hence, it is important to further examine this gene-nutrient interaction.
  The aim was to investigate the role of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 as a genetic predisposing factor modulating the effect of vitamin B-12 on cognitive function.
  A battery of neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for global cognition, was administered at the baseline assessment to 539 Chinese adults aged > or =55 y. The MMSE was repeated at a median 18 mo (n = 376) and a median of 38 mo (n = 247) after baseline. The interaction of vitamin B-12 and APOE epsilon4 on cognitive function was examined in a linear mixed-effects model for MMSE and in a multiple linear regression model for neuropsychological test scores.
  APOE epsilon4 was associated with a lower MMSE score. Vitamin B-12 (natural log transformed) was positively related to MMSE score, and this association was much stronger in APOE epsilon4 carriers than in APOE epsilon4 noncarriers (P for interaction = 0.016). Significant interactions between natural log-transformed vitamin B-12 and APOE epsilon4 were also found for the Digit Span Backward Longest Sequence (P for interaction = 0.013) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test immediate recall (P for interaction = 0.005). Better performance in these 2 tests was associated with vitamin B-12 in APOE epsilon4 carriers but not in APOE epsilon4 noncarriers.
  The association between vitamin B-12 and cognitive function was moderated by APOE epsilon4 status.},

  abstract = {Among elderly without cognitive impairment, poor physical performances have been reported to predict cognitive decline and dementia. Our aim was to explore the predictive value of balance impairment for cognitive decline in 686 community-dwelling Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (REAL.FR study). Being unable to stand on one leg for five seconds or more defined balance impairment. Cognitive decline was assessed using the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score. Co-morbidities, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score, medication, and level of education were assessed at the hospital. MMSE and balance were reported every six months during two years. Linear mixed model analyses were performed. At baseline, participants with balance impairment (15.2% of the sample) were significantly older, had a lower MMSE score and more BPSD, co-morbidities, and medication. After adjustment for the potential covariates, the presence of balance impairment at each assessment was associated with a mean MMSE decline of 9.2 (1.4) points at two years; having no balance impairment at each assessment was associated with a mean MMSE decline of 3.8 (0.3) points at two years (p < 0.001). An abnormal one-leg balance test is a marker of more advanced dementia and predicts a higher rate of cognitive decline.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine whether low to moderate alcohol intake is protective against cognitive decline in older people.
  DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
  SETTING: Community‐based study in Ireland, the Netherlands, and Scotland.
  PARTICIPANTS: Five thousand eight hundred four people (3,000 women) aged 70 to 82 and randomized to pravastatin or placebo in the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk.
  MEASUREMENTS: Alcohol consumption was determined at study baseline. Serial measures of cognitive function over 3.2 years mean follow‐up included Mini‐Mental‐State‐Examination (MMSE), speed of information processing (Stroop and Letter‐Digit Coding tests), and immediate and delayed memory (Picture‐Word Learning test).
  RESULTS: Forty‐two percent of women and 71% of men were alcohol drinkers. Cognitive performance was better for female drinkers than nondrinkers for all cognitive domains over the 3.2‐year follow‐up; no significant effects were seen for men (linear mixed model, including adjusting for possible confounders). The rate of cognitive decline was similar for drinkers and nondrinkers for all cognitive domains, except for MMSE, which declined significantly less in female drinkers than nondrinkers (linear mixed model attenuated rate of decline=0.05 MMSE units per annum, P=.001).
  CONCLUSION: Drinking low to moderate amounts of alcohol may delay age‐associated cognitive decline in older women (including slowing deterioration in global cognitive function), but these apparent benefits were not clearly seen in older men.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT Polymorphisms in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene have been associated with exceptional longevity and lower cardiovascular risk, but associations with memory decline and dementia risk are unclear. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at CETP codon 405 (isoleucine to valine V405; SNP rs5882) is associated with a lower rate of memory decline and lower risk of incident dementia, including Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study comprising 608 community-dwelling adults without dementia aged 70 years or older from the Einstein Aging Study with CETP genotype available. Fifteen participants with prevalent dementia were excluded, and 70 without follow-up—63 lost to follow-up and 7 new to the study—were excluded from the Cox proportional hazards model, which included 523 participants in the analysis. Standardized neuropsychological and neurological measures were administered annually from 1994-2009. Linear mixed-effects models adjusted for sex, education, race, medical comorbidities, and apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 examined associations of V405 genotype with longitudinal performance on cognitive tests of episodic memory (Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test [FCSRT], possible scores of 0-48), attention (Digit Span), and psychomotor speed (Digit Symbol Substitution). The V405 genotype was the main predictor of incident dementia or AD in similarly adjusted Cox proportional hazards models with age as the time scale. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Memory decline and incident dementia. RESULTS Valine allele frequency was 43.5%. A total of 40 cases of incident dementia occurred during follow-up (mean [(SD], 4.3 [3.1] years). Compared with isoleucine homozygotes, valine homozygotes had significantly slower memory decline on the FCSRT (0.43 points per year of age for isoleucine; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.58 to −0.29 vs 0.21 points per year of age for valine; 95% CI, −0.39 to −0.04; difference in linear age slope, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.41; P = .03) and no significant differences on the Digit Span or Digit Symbol Substitution tests. Valine homozygotes also had lower risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.85; P = .02) and AD (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10-0.95; P = .04). CONCLUSION This preliminary report suggests that CETP V405 valine homozygosity is associated with slower memory decline and lower incident dementia and AD risk.},

  abstract = {In this review, evidence is provided that apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotype accounts for the majority of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk and pathology. The three major human isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, are encoded by different alleles (ε2, ε3, ε4) and regulate lipid metabolism and redistribution. ApoE isoforms differ in their effects on AD risk and pathology. Clinical and epidemiological data have indicated that the ε4 allele may account for 50% of AD in the United States. Further, the rarity of AD among carriers of the ε2 allele suggests that allelic variations in the gene encoding this protein may account for over 95% of AD cases. ApoE4 disrupts memory function in rodents. Further studies have indicated that fragments of apoE may contribute to both plaque and tangle formation. Thus, the epidemiologic and basic science evidence suggest that apoE genotype accounts for the vast majority of AD risk and pathology.}
